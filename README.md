# UsefulTests
This is a list of some useful model names and tests that most people encounter with during data analysis. I tried to incorporate maximum tests or models with there null hypothesis and p-values. It also includes how to interpret the p-value and what remedial measures you could take to solve the issues. It also includes the R library and function you can use in your library.
